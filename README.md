- Intended to be used for CI 
- See the `docker` folder for build examples
- All the heavy lifting is done in the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK)
- The main routine is adapted from [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericwhite/2010/03/04/validate-open-xml-documents-using-the-open-xml-sdk-2-0/)
